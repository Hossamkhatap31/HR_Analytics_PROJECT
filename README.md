# HR-Analysis-Attrition

Welcome to the *HR Attrition Analysis* project! This repository explores the factors driving employee turnover and provides data-driven insights to help human resources teams anticipate, understand, and mitigate attrition risks.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
During a recent review of HR records, we noticed a relative increase in the percentage of employees leaving the company. To investigate, we applied a series of analyses and pivot-based dashboards to reveal both primary and secondary causes of attrition.

---

## ✨ Key Findings
- *Primary Drivers:* Identified core factors (e.g., job satisfaction, tenure, compensation) most directly influencing high attrition rates.  
- *Secondary Factors:* Highlighted additional influences (e.g., department, location, training frequency) that impact subsets of departing employees.  
- *Actionable Insights:* Recommendations for targeted retention strategies and prioritized interventions.

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques
- *Excel Power Query & Power Pivot:* Data ingestion, cleaning, and model creation.  
- *Pivot Tables & Charts:* Interactive exploration of key metrics.  
- *Data Visualization:* Clear, dynamic dashboards built with Excel.

## 📝 Data Sources
The analysis uses anonymized HR data, including:  
- Employee demographics (age, department, tenure)  
- Compensation and promotion history  
- Performance ratings and engagement scores
