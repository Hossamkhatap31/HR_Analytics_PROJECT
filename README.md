HR-Analysis-Attrition-
Welcome to the HR Attrition Analysis project! This repository explores the factors driving employee turnover and provides data‑driven insights to help human resources teams anticipate, understand, and mitigate attrition risks.

🚀 Project Overview

During a recent review of HR records, we noticed a relative increase in the percentage of employees leaving the company. To investigate, we applied a series of analyses and pivot‑based dashboards to reveal both primary and secondary causes of attrition.

✨ Key Findings

Primary Drivers: Identified core factors (e.g., job satisfaction, tenure, compensation) most directly influencing high attrition rates.

Secondary Factors: Highlighted additional influences (e.g., department, location, training frequency) that impact subsets of departing employees.

Actionable Insights: Recommendations for targeted retention strategies and prioritized interventions.

🛠️ Tools & Techniques

Excel Power Query & Power Pivot: Data ingestion, cleaning, and model creation.

Pivot Tables & Charts: Interactive exploration of key metrics.

Data Visualization: Clear, dynamic dashboards built with Excel.

📝 Data Sources

The analysis uses anonymized HR data, including:

Employee demographics (age, department, tenure)

Compensation and promotion history

Performance ratings and engagement scores

Training and development records
